						<h2>Ratatouille</h2>
						<p>Here is some more information about Rataouille</p>
					</header>

					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/rat.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<p> The movie opens up showing a televised document about French chef, Auguste Gusteau. Gusteau is the owner of 5-star restaurant, Gusteau's, being the youngest chef to ever have a 5-star rating and having a best selling book, Anyone Can Cook. Everyone loved Gusteau, except for food critic Anton Ego. Throughout the years, Ego tries to put down Gusteau's reputation as he doesn't believe in his motto, "Anyone Can Cook." The movie then shifts to Remy, a Parisian rat who lives in the attic of a French country home owned by a old woman with his brother Emile and a pack led by his father Django. </p>
					<p> Remy is gifted with a keen sense of smell and taste, which he used to save his father from eating food that was covered with rat poison. By this point, Django suddenly believed that Remy's gift was great. Remy felt pleased about this, until Django gave him the job of being poison checker, which involved smelling all the stolen food to tell whether it was poisoned or not. Unlike the other rats, Remy disliked garbage food and is fascinated by the humans, to Django's dismay. Django forbids Remy to go into the kitchen (where all the food isn't poison) and away from the humans as they are dangerous. But Remy ignores it and goes into the kitchen of the house and watches a document of French chef, Auguste Gusteau, in which Remy is heavily inspired by. </p>
					<p> The next day, Remy discovers a mushroom, and with the help of Emile, Remy cooks the mushroom with the cheese Emile found on the rooftop of the house. However, lightning strikes the two, but it also cooks the mushroom Remy was preparing, in which Remy takes a huge liking too. Remy wants to add saffron to it, but it is in the kitchen. As Remy searches for it, Emile is feeling really uncomfortable being in the kitchen, scared that the old lady will wake up. Aside from his great sense of smell, Remy also reveals that he can read and have watched television, something rats never do and approve of. </p>
